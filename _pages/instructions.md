title: "Detailed Transcription Instructions"
---

This page contains links to both written and video tutorials for working with FromThePage and transcribing the menus in the DishbyDish project. 

## The Basic Concept

The information that we are hoping to get from the menus includes: 

- names of items found on the menus
- descriptions of those items
- prices of those items
- other details about the dishes--serving size, allergen information (if present)
- names and descriptions in other languages (if present)

Menus are very different one from another and these differences can make it difficult from them to be compared. We can use some simple practices, however, to make sure that the DishbyDish project is able to analyze the transcriptions most effectively. The main approach we use is tabular encoding.
