meeting with Provost (M Benedict)

-feedback on the process welcome
-student enrollment dwindling in CHSS; university is growing
-only college where numbers are not growing
-very focused so far in CHSS; want to grow a few more
-flat budget for last three years, not been adding faculty in the last few years
-graduate research university - want to be in the top 5/10 ME universitiesy
-25% Qatari, 40% resident, rest from abroad (Africa, S Asia, some GCC) -- most students from QU, then from EC
-application pool (21000 applications, 350 students, 100 Qataris apply)
-all Q qualified are admitted, many residents, 1% selectivity for intl (satisfactory for government)
-intl students funded, Qs have tuition rebate, but no stipend
-50% student have a FT job **** 
-65%F 35%M - across the university
-translation institute - impact on culture, nation 
-Qatarisation? - less for faculty than in the country in general and for staff
-intl students -- post-study visas, work and internships?
-only national university in Education City, and basically only graduate institution : recruitment from EC UG institutions 
-faculty collaborations exist, can do more
-PhD programs could include more faculty affiliations

-use the review for internal purposes, accreditation
-local accredited, do not have US-based accreditation yet
-36 degree programs - "sanity purposes"

-stem / non-stem bridging 

-QF: precision medicine, AI, progressive education, sustainability
****chatGPT -- faculty need to be guided; trend in scholarly publications, need for guidelines
-staff turn around 
-library - all colleges moving & merging, to a new space, new director 2 yrs ago
-new expertise, in place for a few months

-report (Powerpoint on departure) 
-1, 2 or 3 reports? - as we like

-why are numbers declining? 

-Doha Graduate Center -- not QF -- social sciences mostly -- competing for faculty more than students

- top down desire for multidisciplinary degrees only - allows for unis to distinguish themselves, cost-effective, anti-silo


***** PhD programs 

since 2019
admitted 10 students this year
research methdology course lacking
qualifying exams different from college to college - 2 essays base don 30 essays
co-supervision inside hbku & ec

-self-funding student for intl students 
-50% waiver for Q & residents

-challenges: large number of applications over the years
-constraints on supply side - matching of expertise
-number of hours devoted to PhD students "not defined"
-****N American model? - stipends - is it the most appropriate for the country? ***by design 
-students have realistically FT jobs

-not organic relationship between (QNRF) faculty funding and graduate work -- but sometimes is post hoc (unlike the College of Engineering)
-no possibility for redeploying funds for overhead 

-careers beyond the academy? (but in the MENA there is a vivid environment for HE qualifications)
-students want to be able to apply their research in situ 
-genre of thesis is different : is there support for such students? 
	A: students have institutional, community structured
-action research is centered in the Access Hub
-TA opportunities for those who want to 
-no doctoral school yet
-need for 2 publication: articles, chapters (but maybe project, coauthorship with superviser, review papers) 

-conceptual and methodological combinations! 

-50% research (PhD supervision included) 
-30% teaching 20% service

****MA programs 

-started with specialized programs
-started in 2017 
-5 cohorts (DHS, WSD) 
-centralized advising

-summer time : intership / mini research project
-desirability to reduce hours from 39 to 36 
-yearly pedagogy reflection 

- special topics : adjuncts in Qatar -- sub-specialities for interesting topics 
- MAs - numbers are ok for the faculty 
- few scholarships for international students --budget was cut during COVID 
- admissions office in college - 1700+ applications, one third of which truly qualify - need for a more efficient system / signal more selectivity 

- marketing strategy of the university
- qatarisation -- move toward focusing on Qataris
- QF 12-18 months post-graduation 

- GPT info sessions
- CFAST - educational technology 
- prohibiting generative AI is next to impossible --> create a framework for working 

-online students? 

****questions for DHS

-strategies for open data collection in social media sphere
costs 
-building information studies for the middle east 
-infrastructural support for MA projects
-MA thesis stop at one in F22? no more? 
-what institutional projects 
- number of Q students dropped significantly? 

DH in the world - service to the university, 

-group work and collective projects? 

-projects with museum sector? outreach? 
-other media? generative AI & its chalnges?
	- focus on translation shows its language-based focus

-relationships with other campuses in EC? Doha Graduate Center?

-job profiles of graduates? 
-relation to research computing, library, IT, etc
-models for thesis writing / expectations -- very different kinds of topics
-course contact hours 2 hours = 3 credits? 
-introduction to DH: readings outdated? two papers? 

AWARE center - literacy, academic literacy 
-counseling, mental health & disability (at the college level)

Emerging technologies - very popular in the university - where to go next? 

- possible synergies between Womens Studies and DHS 
- creation of unbiased models 
- embedding in creative industries 
- role of alumni 

- personalized learning in computational methods - small classes 
- need for programming skills? 
- students can go to CMU (for coding); elsewhere (for Arabic)


Dean and Associate Deans 

- turning the conversation of impact around 
- Digital Societies 
- Intercultural Communication 
- Translation institute - 12 languages
- IRB - stumbling blocks for some kinds of research
- 

- AI, behavioral sciences
- vision "as reacting"

MA 

POS
***WSD - learn from international students, profs have experiences of the regions
NEG
retention an issue
goes beyond gender studies
2 research methods courses, but the 2nd was really broad 
DHS has a lab, and internships, but we don't 
-we need to start the thesis writing process earlier 

POS 
***DHS more focused aspect on digital tools other than what you would use in your work field 
really helped with work (Gephi, AntConc, DocScope, Tableau)
easy to change the major here
having professors from different fields
benefits to workplace: brings critical thinking and new skills to products, services, work environment (chatGPT)

NEG 
more digital tools (text analysis) --> maybe different courses, more technical and theoretical 
the research methods class was very general--need more targeted for DHS (kinds of data)
economics and social theory is not that useful for students
compromises for both majors 
internships are not so useful for people with jobs / independent project was a better option 

great to have courses 4-7pm (all over Qatar); depending on the batch 
opportunities to draw on the advantages of both programs
easy to switch between programs 
disconnect between the two parts of the co-taught class 

PhD 

POS
two interdisciplinary courses
an elective could be eliminated (to avoid unbeneficial courses)
flexibility in taking the elective in another school 
a lot of support for writing 
mixture with other policy, entrepreneurship, 

NEG
experience of advising varies from one student to another 
no stipend for PhD students -- a small budget for research books
no set working spaces for PhD students 

Exploration in Global Humanities -- not useful (other found useful for interdisciplinarity)
Explorations in Interdisciplinarity -- would have preferred to start writing (did not find engaging)
Qualifying Exam -- 60 references, 30 for each essay -- the are not flexible and changeable -- but why do these need to be unrelated to the direct subject?? (focus around the topic)
Electives -- the time spent in class should be used to their advantage 
(on the other hand, electives are v useful for building up the topic)

research methods course is redundant for PhD students

for some students having structure in programs is very good, for others less so

fees for PhD are higher for elective courses than for MA students

- less student engagement after COVID (need for doctoral student socializing)
- little social life for international students  
- IRB process (took 3-6 months) needs to be streamlined. 
- conference funding for travel 
- student publications as requirement - quite hard for students - lead time is very different 

- publications within the university 

- exchanges in the Middle East, with other universities 
- collaborating with industry partners 
- IRB (via Georgetown) was onerous 

- lots of students who came from technology backgrounds 
 

graduates: 

#1 Journalist: program was an eye opener, AI, organized a conference at AlJazeera "AI and media," follow up conference, would have been more involved in practical data analysis  

#2 Research assistant/future PhD student: corporate data analyst turned feminist | Bahrainiya | WSD program was an eye opener | DH has helped me to work outside my field | how to approach question from a social justice perspective | how to unlearn privilege & how to be a part of my research | I would have gotten more hard skills -- coding, data skills. Fought for college-wide mental health. 

#3 Community College Lecturer: learning by doing gain confidence, I would have teamed up with someone on the ground (in Tunisia) to do research. 

#4 Oil&Gas Company / digital solutions project lead in IT: came from IT and Engineering, but now don't judge quickly in technical matters, helped me a lot in the social aspect of tech (user adoption), the core courses were a stretch, the guest speakers were beneficial, OWEN (library)

#5 Arab Center for Research and Policy / Future PhD student. At Georgetown, I didn't dare research on the community. WSD : learned how to craft my own project. writing on Baluchi community with ethnographic work. Small size was beneficial, professors are very approachable. 

#6 Ministry of Communication and IT / new mom. Info systems studies. Information & Politics & Theory. Would have liked to do more hands on works. Better understanding of the larger issues of society. How to use technology to improve our society. 

#7 Petroleum engineer. WSD. Reading and summarization. Challenging coming from a technical background. Women & Leadership in Oil & Gas. To be equipped with the tools to speak up and give voice to women. If I were to do a PhD it would be in humanities and social sciences. 

#8 Mother. QU in Public Relations / Mass Communications. DHS. Soundscaping and globalization.  

#9 Researcher. Preferred the first two semester. WSD in the same courses with DHS and Translation 


alumnae testimonies : would be good for publicity and community growing


student research forum | have graduate student conference | bring other GCC students into dialogue 


Associate Dean for Research
