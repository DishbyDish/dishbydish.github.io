There are lots of ways you can get involved in Dish by Dish. 

If you would like to help us by contributing an image of a menu, you can go to this post. 

If you would like to help us transcribe, we have prepared a series of tutorials. 

To begin transcribing, open the project site in FromThePage [here](https://fromthepage.com/menus). You may want to familiarize yourself with the how to videos we have prepared below. You are allowed to transcribe a small amount without making an account, but be sure to get your own account if you want to do more. 

> You can contribute in any language you feel comfortable in, but we especially need citizen researchers who are good at typing Arabic!
