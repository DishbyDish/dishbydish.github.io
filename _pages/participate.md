There are lots of ways you can get involved in Dish by Dish. Our project thrives with the help of digital volunteers. 

If you would like to help us by contributing an image of a menu, you can go to this [post](https://dishbydish.github.io/blog/contributing-menus/) for suggestions. 

To begin transcribing, open the project site in FromThePage [here](https://fromthepage.com/menus). 

> You can contribute in any language you feel comfortable in, but we especially need citizen researchers who are good at typing Arabic!
