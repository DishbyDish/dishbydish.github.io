Dish By Dish
    
Countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are major international hubs with residents hailing from all over the world. Of course, in them we find the traditional foods of Eastern Arabia (known as "Khaleeji" cooking), but there are also many different global food cultures and interesting fusions on offer. 

Dish by Dish is a community project that aims to understand about the Gulf region through the lens of culinary practices. The project encourages collaboration in research between academia and the general public, faculty and students. We’re transcribing restaurant menus--dish by dish--from local and regional restaurants using the [FromThePage](https://fromthepage.com/menus) platform. It’s a big job so we need your help! 

In the ever-growing collection of menus you will find many languages; they typically contain English and Arabic, but be on the lookout for Amharic, Chinese, Italian, Malayalam, Nepali, Tagalog, Urdu and others. 

Dish by Dish is a project of [Citizen Researcher](https://citizenresearcher.hosting.nyu.edu/) in the Office of Research Outreach at [NYU Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/).
