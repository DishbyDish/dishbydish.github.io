Dish By Dish
    
Countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are major international hubs with residents hailing from all over the world. Of course, in them we find the traditional foods of Eastern Arabia (known as "Khaleeji" cooking), but there are also many different global food cultures and interesting fusions on offer. 

Dish by Dish is a crowdsourcing project that builds community around studying a growing collection of restaurant menus from the UAE, transcribing them "dish by dish". We use the [FromThePage](https://fromthepage.com/menus) crowdsourcing platform. 

We hope to understand what menus from food establishments of all kinds can tell us about the complex landscape of food and culture in the region. In the ever-growing collection of menus you will find many languages; they typically contain English and Arabic, but be on the lookout for Amharic, Chinese, Malayalam, Tagalog, Urdu and others. 

Dish by Dish is a project of [Citizen Researcher](https://citizenresearcher.hosting.nyu.edu/) in the Office of Research Outreach at [NYU Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/). We use this Github site to write about the results and the development of the project.
